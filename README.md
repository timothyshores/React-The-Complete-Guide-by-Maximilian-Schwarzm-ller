Personal notes for the React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

## Introduction

React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces using components. React allows developer to create web application that run in the browser and feel like native mobile apps because web pages do not reload the entire page.

Every webpage can be divided and subdivided into different components such as headers, navbars, search bars, filters, bodies, columns, cards, titles, avatars, code snippets and footers. This keeps code manageable and easier to work in front end teams. React components can be reused and repurposed. React components can be thought of as custom HTML elements.

Components always stard with a capitalixed letter. E.g. a component named `Card` is fine but a component named `card` is will result in an error.
