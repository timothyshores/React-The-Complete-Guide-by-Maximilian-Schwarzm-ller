# Introduction

React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces using components. React allows developer to create web application that run in the browser and feel like native mobile apps because web pages do not reload the entire page.

Every webpage can be divided and subdivided into different components such as headers, navbars, search bars, filters, bodies, columns, cards, titles, avatars, code snippets and footers. This keeps code manageable and easier to work in front end teams. React components can be reused and repurposed. React components can be thought of as custom HTML elements.

Components always star with a capitalized letter. E.g. a component named `Card` is fine but a component named `card` is will result in an error.

## Refactoring HTML and CSS to React

Say we want to create cards that display a person's name and age. We can open up a CodePen with the following HTML and CSS files.

```html
<div class="person">
  <h1>Tim</h1>
  <p>Age: 31 years old</p>
</div>

<div class="person">
  <h1>Max</h1>
  <p>Age: 28 years old</p>
</div>
```

```css
.person {
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 10px;
  border: 1px solid #eee;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 2px #ccc;
  width: 200px;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

This will look like

![Example 1 - HTML and CSS only](/images/1_introduction/1.png)

The issue is that we are repeating the same `<div>`, `<h1>` and `<p>` structure in our HTML file. We would like to create a function that encapsulates this structure and just pass in the person's name and age.

We can refactor this into React code by including React along with React DOM and Babel into our [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).

**HTML**

```html
<div id="root"></div>
```

**Javascript**

```javascript
const Person = ({ name, age }) => {
  return (
    <div class="person">
      <h1>{name}</h1>
      <p>Age: {age} years old</p>
    </div>
  );
};

let App = (
  <>
    <Person name="Tim" age="31" />
    <Person name="Max" age="28" />
  </>
);

ReactDOM.render(App, document.querySelector("#root"));
```

![Example 1 - Refactored into React](/images/1_introduction/2.png)

By refactoring the original HTML and CSS into React code we can simply pass in the name and age properties into the `<Person>` component and React will renders these as `<h1>` and `<p>` elements inside of a `<div>` element like in the previous example exceot we no longer have to repeat the same HTML elements in our HTML file.

# Next Generation JavaScript

React is written using features from ES6 and beyond. Below is a quick refresher on ES6 and ES7 features that are frequently seen in React applications.

## Keywords let vs const

The keywords let and const are new keywords for declaring a variable in JavaScript. Use let if you want to reassign the variable and use const if you do not want to reassign the variable.

## Arrow Functions

Old syntax for declaring a function

```javascript
function myFnc() {
    ...
}
```

Can be rewritten as

```javascript
const myFnc = () => {
    ...
}
```

Arrow function syntax fixes the issue with the `this` keyword in Javascript.

If a function is a single line return statement you can remove the `{}` and the `return` keyword. If a function only accepts one arguement then you can remove the `()`.

As an example

```javascript
const increment = num => {
  return (num = num + 1);
};
```

Can be refactored to

```javascript
const increment = num => num++;
```

## Exports & Imports

---

Javascript code can be split up between multiple files. This ensures that each Javascript file is manageable and makes it easier to split up work between a team.

Including the `default` keyword in your export will allow the file to be renamed when it is imported into another Javascript file. In this example we're exporting a person object from `person.js` and importing it into `app.js`.

**person.js**

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Tim"
};

export default person;
```

**app.js**

```javascript
import person from "./person.js";
import p from "./person.js";
```

---

A named export does not include the `default` keyword and is imported using `{}`. In this example we're exporting a person object from `person.js` and importing it into `app.js`. Since there's no default we need to tell Javascript what we're specifically referring to.

**utility.js**

```javascript
export const increment = num => num++;
```

**app.js**

```javascript
import { increment } from "./utility.js";
```

You can assign an alias by using the `as` keyword. For example in our `app.js` file we could import `increment` as `inc` with the following import statement.

```javascript
import { increment as inc } from "./utility.js";
```

You can import everything from a given JavaScript file using `*`

```javascript
import * as utils from "./utility.js";
```

---

## Classes

Syntax for declaring a class

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor() {
    this.name = "Tim";
  }
  printName() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}
```

Syntax for instantiating a class

```javascript
const person = new Person();
person.printName();
```

New classes can inherit properties and methods from existing classes

```javascript
class Child extends Parent
```

## Classes, Properties and Methods

Declaring properties in ES6

```javascript
constructor() {
    this.myProperty = 'value'
}
```

Declaring properties in ES7+

```javascript
myProperty = "value";
```

Declaring methods in ES6

```javascript
myMethod() { ... }
```

Declaring methods using arrow functions in ES7+ abstracts away the `this` keyword.

```javascript
myMethod = () => { ... }
```

This course will use ES7+ syntax to declare properties and methods in classes.

**ES6 Classes**

```javascript
class Mammal {
  constructor() {
    this.gender = "male";
  }

  printGender() {
    console.log(this.gender);
  }
}

class Human extends Mammal {
  constructor() {
    super(); // inherit Mammal constructor and printGender method
    this.name = "Tim";
    this.gender = "male";
  }

  printName() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}
```

This can be refactored into ES7+ resulting in the following

```javascript
class Mammal {
  gender = "male";
  printGender = () => console.log(this.gender);
}

class Human extends Mammal {
  name = "Tim";
  gender = "male";
  printName = () => console.log(this.name);
}
```

## Spread and Rest Operators

Syntax is 3 consecutive dots like this `...`

Spread operator is used to split up array elements or object properties.

**Spread operator examples**

```javascript
const oldArray = [1, 2, 3];
const newArray = [...oldArray, 4];
console.log(newArray); // returns [1, 2, 3, 4]

const oldObj = { name: "Tim" };
const newObj = { ...oldObj, age: 31 };
console.log(newObj); // returns { name: 'Tim', age: 31 }
```

Rest operator is used to merge a list of function arguments into an array

**Rest operator examples**

```javascript
function sortArgs(...args) {
  return args.sort(); // .sort() is a built in function for arrays
}

const evens(...args) => args.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
```

The function `sortArgs` can receive any number of arguments.

## Destructuring

### Arrays

```javascript
const array = ["Hello", "World"];
[str1, str2] = array;
console.log(str1); // 'Hello'
console.log(str2); // 'World'
```

### Objects

```javascript
const person = {name: 'Tim', age: 31};
{name, age, gender} = person;
console.log(name); // 'Tim'
console.log(age); // 31
console.log(gender); // undefined
```

## Reference and Primitive Types

Numbers, strings and booleans and primitive data types while objects and arrays are reference types.

```javascript
let num1 = 1;
const num2 = num1;
num1 = 2;
console.log(num2); // 1
```

**Explaination:** num2 creates a copy of the number 1 since numbers are primitive data types. When num2 is console logged it returns 1.

```javascript
const obj1 = { name: "Tim" };
const obj2 = obj1;
obj1.name = "Max";
console.log(obj2); // { name: "Max" }
```

**Explaination:** obj2 refers a pointer in memory to obj1 since objects are reference data types. When obj2 is console logged it returns Max since it is pointing to obj1.

If we want to create a copy of `obj1` into `obj2` we can spread in the properties of `obj1` into `obj2`.

```javascript
const obj1 = { name: "Tim" };
const obj2 = { ...obj1 };
obj1.name = "Max";
console.log(obj2); // { name: "Tim" }
```

## Array Functions

Built in JavaScript array functions include `.filter()`, `.sort()`, `.map()`, `.reduce()` and more.

`.map()` preforms a function on every element in a given array

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const doubleEachNumber = arr.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(doubleEachNumber([1, 2, 3])); // [2, 4, 6]
```

# Basics

A build workflow is coding in a local text editor application such as VS Code on your own machine rather than in the browser on websites such as CodePen. In real applications you want to ship code that is as small and optimized as possible using the latest features in Javascript, linting and CSS prefixes.

**Requirements**

- Depdenency management tool such with npm or yarn
- Bundler such with webpack
- Next generation Javascript compiler such with babel
- Use a development server with live server or a hot reload

Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) and then run the following commands in the terminal

```terminal
npx create-react-app react-complete-guide
cd react-complete-guide
npm start
```

This will create the directory [react-complete-guide](./react-complete-guide/) along with subfolders and files including `.gitignore`, `package.json`, `README.md` and `yarn.lock`.

React applications are mounted in [public/index.html](./react-complete-guide/public/index.html). On line 31 in `<div id="root"></div>`. This is done in the [src/index.js](react-complete-guide/src/index.js) file on lines 7 - 12.

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

React components are like custom HTML elements that are used to build a React application. Every component is required to render HTML to the Document Object Model (DOM).

In [src/App.js](react-complete-guide/src/App.js) the following functions are equivalent

```javascript
const App = () => (
  <div className="App">
    <h1>My React App</h1>
  </div>
);
```

```javascript
const App = () =>
  React.createElement(
    "div",
    { className: "App" },
    React.createElement("h1", null, "My React App")
  );
```

The previous example is clearly more concise and easier to read. This is how your React code gets commpiled and works under the hood.

## JSX

JSX is Javascript like syntax but certain words are reserved such as `class` which needs to be written as `className` in JSX. It avoids the need to write React.createElement every time that you want to create a new element and instead allows you to write to short hand notation instead. Under the hood it compiles down to a deeply nested React.createElement function call.

JSX is syntactic sugar for Javascript.

JSX needs to have a single root element.

The following is **not** allowed.

```jsx
const App = () =>
  return (
    <h1>My React App</h1>
    <h2>Subtitle</h2>
  );
```

The following is allowed.

```jsx
const App = () =>
  return(
    <div>
      <h1>My React App</h1>
      <h2>Subtitle</h2>
    <div>
  );
```

## Functional Components

Components are Uppercase. If you were to create a component that displayed a card then the file would be Card.js and typically this would be located in a `/Card/` directory.

A React component is simply a Javascript function that returns JSX.

`src/Card/Card.js`

```jsx
import React from "react";

const Card = () => {
  return <p>Card</p>;
};
```

`src/App.js`

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Card from "./Card/Card";

const App = () => {
  return <Card />;
};
```

Lowercase component names are reversed for html keywords such as `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<a href>`, etc. while uppercase component names are reversed for React components such as `<Card />` or `<Container />`. Self Closing Tags are component without elements or other components nested inside.
